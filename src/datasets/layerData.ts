      The data is processed into a Level 3 product with a resolution of 0.02 by 0.02 degrees, and the imagery you see is displayed at about 2 km resolution.
      To ensure accuracy, the layer is filtered, and only includes high-quality data points, based on key quality checks and sunlight conditions (solar zenith angle).`,

      Multiple satellites are used to detect these active fires.

      Industrial sources like steel mills and reflective surfaces like solar panels may create similar signals, but are typically filtered out during data processing.
      Fire detections can be impacted by environmental factors including cloud cover, dense smoke, and the terrain.
      <br/><br/>
      The colors represent the fire's radiative power (FRP), which is a measure of the heat energy released by the fire, expressed in megawatts (MW).
      Higher FRP values often indicate more intense burning within a group of fire pixels, though these values can vary depending on imaging conditions.
      If FRP data isn't available for a location, a placeholder value is used.
      
      <strong>Note: </strong> We only display fire detections made using the VIIRS method, and with FRP > 1 MW.
